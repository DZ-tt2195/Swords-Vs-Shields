  update: 'I got my irl copy of Pacific a bit ago, and thought, this looks easy enough
    to program. and it was, I already did all 80 cards

    Tokens always run in
    the order of: port, hatchery, hotel, boat, factory, fish, balloon

    The card
    images are me taking crappy pictures with my phone

    with the power of reusing
    code from MCB, all of this only took 3 days of work

    Since all the cards
    are done there''s probably not going to be many updates. I guess some ui could
    be better (and I can try to get the actual mat in)

    even if the game designer
    and publisher ok''d it, I don''t think I''m brave enough to have this program
    go public, it may stay unlisted forever

    secret history for game when'
